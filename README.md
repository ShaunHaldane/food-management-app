Ever wondered how much money that you are wasting on food that you bought but did not eat? This app calculates money that you are spending and wasting on food.
After you create an account, you will have the option to add food items to a database after you have been shopping. The app will let you know which food items 
you have in stock and it will give details about when you should use those items as shown in picture 1.

money spent and money wasted as shown in picture 2.
